# Gestalt Principles

**Gestalt** is a psychology theory that define how people interact and produce order from visual stimuli. There are 7 Geralt Principles of visual perceptions that can be applied to improve our presentations.

## 7 Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception
1. **Figure-ground**

3. **Similarity**

  Objects with same size, color, format are seen as part of a group. This can be usefull to:
  - Enfasize an information on a table. For example, we can change the color (or background color) of the phrase or value that we want to enfasize on the presentation, knowing that the audience will probably focus first on this piece of information.

4. **Proximity**

  Nearby objects are seen as part of a group. This can be usefull to:
  - Guide the audience attention on a specific way. For example, if there are some vertical dots on the background, the audience will probably visualize each column of dots as a group and the visualization order will be: each column starting on the left and going to the right.
  - Inform (without saying) that the information can be divided in some groups. For example, we can approximate some points and create the impression of a group.
  
5. **Common region**

6. **Continuity**

  Similar to the Closure principle, our mind create continuity to some formats and symbols. So, even if a rectangle is over a circle, with just a part of the circle visible, our mind "knows" the continuity of the circle that is hidden. This can be usefful to:
  - Enfasize a chart by removing x or y axis (depending on the situation).
  
7. **Closure**

  We like to complete simple formats in our minds, so even if a geometric symbol doesn't have a complete outline, we can identify it. This can be usefull to:
  - Enfasize a chart by removing the background color and the outline.

8. **Focal point**
