## 7 Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception
1. **Figure-ground**

3. **Similarity**

4. **Proximity**

  According to this principle, we usually think that nearby objects are part of a group. This can be usefull to:
  - Guide the audience attention on a specific way. For example, if there are some vertical dots on the background, the audience will probably visualize each column of dots as a group and the visualization order will be: each column starting on the left and going to the right.
  - Inform (without saying) that the information can be divided in some groups. For example, we can approximate some points and create the impression of a group.

6. **Continuity**

8. **Focal point**
